Assignment: Add an image to your About Me page and edit the CSS so the image and paragraphs are side-by-side.

Grade:  95

Comment: You had the right idea, and it was tough...  There were a couple of things you needed to change to make it work:
    1) Put a specific width percent on the #left css so the div didn't take up the whole page
    2) Also use a smaller image size; I put in a small percent again to make it work.
    3) You want to remove the <style> tags in your <head>, because you say img left there and you say id right on the image.
